  "readme": "# rulerz\n\n##### By the guys at [Forge Software](http://www.forgecrafted.com/)\n\nA simple Atom [package](https://atom.io/packages/rulerz) to mark each of your cursors with a vertical ruler. Inspired by the Sublime Text plugin [CursorRuler](https://github.com/icylace/CursorRuler).\n\n[![screencast gif](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/281467/5994471/d3648c72-aa42-11e4-8916-bdd4705ed55c.gif)](http://www.forgecrafted.com)\n\n## Styles\n\nYou can change the appearance of the rulers by adding a rule to [your stylesheet](https://atom.io/docs/latest/using-atom-basic-customization#style-tweaks). For example:\n\n```less\natom-text-editor.is-focused::shadow {\n  ruler-view.rulerz {\n    border-left: 1px solid black;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe default color is taken from the variable `@text-color-subtle`. By continuing to base your ruler color on this value (modified with LESS functions), your ruler will match whatever syntax theme you have active:\n\n```less\natom-text-editor.is-focused::shadow {\n  ruler-view.rulerz {\n    border-left: 1px dotted fade(mix(@text-color-subtle, limegreen), 5%);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease [report any issues on Github](https://github.com/forgecrafted/rulerz/issues).\n\nPatches welcome and encouraged.\n\n1.
